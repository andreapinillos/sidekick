# Sidekick

A social media application that allows the user to find a buddy to do an activity with.

## Description

This application demonstrates a full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS/Javascript and ReactJS and elements from the Bootstrap framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and uses the database MongoDB.

This application prompts the user to log in through facebook authentication, the user will then create a profile and select an activity in which they need a buddy for. After selecting an activity, the user will be presented with people in the area that also want to do that specific activity.

## Technical Information

We used Mongoose to render the users information stored in their profile.
